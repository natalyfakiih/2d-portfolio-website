  fridge: `ðŸŽ€ About Me <br>
hiii I'm Nataly Fakih, a curious and creative front-end developer & game maker with a soft spot for art and UI design. I'm currently a computer science student, I build interactive websites, playful mini-games, and sometimes spend way too long perfecting a loading animation.
When I'm not coding, I'm probably making handmade accessories, volunteering, or reorganizing my bookmarks for the 5th time. 
I love combining logic with creativity and I'm always looking to grow, experiment, and connect with other passionate creators.

  table: `A drawer full of mystery (and maybe a few chocolate wrappers). You'll find sketches, to-do lists, code scribbles, and miniatures I can't throw away.`,
